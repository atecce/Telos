Having trouble telling how I feel
But I can dance, dance, dance
Couldn't possibly tell you how I mean
But I can dance, dance, dance

So when I'm tripping my feet, look at the beat
The words are written in the sand
When I'm shaking my hips, look for the swing
The words are written in the air

Ooh dance, I was a dancer all along
Dance, dance, dance
Words could never make up for what you do

Easy conversations, no such thing
No, I'm shy, shy, shy
My hips they lie cause in reality
I'm shy, shy, shy

So when I'm tripping my feet, look at the ground
The words are written in the dust
When I'm shaking my hips, look for the swing
The words are written in the air

Ooh dance, I was a dancer all along
Dance, dance, dance
Words could never make up for what you do

Ooh dance, I was a dancer all along
Dance, dance, dance
Words could never make up for what you do

Ooh dance, I was a dancer all along
Dance, dance, dance
Words could never make up for what you do

Dance, dance, dance
Dance, dance, dance
Dance, dance, dance
Dance, dance, dance
Dance, dance, dance
Dance, dance, dance
Dance, dance, dance
Dance, dance, dance
Dance, dance, dance
Dance, dance, dance
