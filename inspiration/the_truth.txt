[Roisin Murphy]
Go ...

Go to the mountain if you must
Go to the burning bush
Happy would ease your troubled mind
I'll be prepared to stay behind?

I know you better than you think I do
Don't worry dear, this is why I fell in love with you
The man in the looking glass
Is looking back at you at last

You can't hide from the truth
Because the truth is all there is
You can't hide from the truth
Because the truth is all there is
You can't hide from the truth
Because the truth is all there is
You can't hide

If happy times are too few and far between
It's a pity dear, we can't erase the things we've seen
So disappear, vanish if you wish
Just go before you're swallowed up by bitterness

And the truth is you can't hide from the truth
And the truth hurts because the truth is all there is
I realized some time ago that I would have to let you go

May not be true to say that you'd return one day
But in your present state, you may as well not be here at all
You wear a thin disguise, it's from yourself you hide
Just take a look at us, we are heading for a fall

[J-Live]
Now presiding in this court of hip-hop
Justice, my rap forte?
Judge, jury, bailiff, and prosecuting D.A.
Et ceteris paribus
My modus operandi
It's carpe diem whether de facto or de jure
Comprende?
The people versus, you and your sensei
Teaching that style of word-play
Week of the Wednesday
Regardless of what your friends say
They're all dissable
Stricken from the record and deemed inadmissable
And this long arm of the law grabs a mic to
Shoot dope lines first and ask questions later
The death sentence of this live litigator
Will close the case tighter than the jaws of a 'gator
Stenographer steady loggin' the jargon
That your counselors are barkin', in hopes of a plea bargain
But when you read back verbatim
What they're saying to persuade them
They realize exactly how I've played them
I come with the truth, whole truth and nothing but
'Cause the truth hurts just as much as fuckin' with lies will
I brew skill with free fills from now until
Plagiarizing MC's get their flows distilled

[Roisin Murphy]
Baby I won't die without you by my side
As long as you return into these arms that burn
Baby I won't die just take a look inside
Into these eyes that burn, come to these arms that yearn

I won't die, if you leave me high
I won't die if you're not by my side

And the truth hurts because the truth is all there is
And the truth hurts because the truth is all there is

You can't hide from the truth, cause the truth is all there is
You can't hide from the truth, cause the truth is all there is
You can't hide from the truth, cause the truth is all there is
You can't hide from the truth, cause the truth is all there is
You can't hide from the truth, cause the truth is all there is
You can't hide from the truth, cause the truth is all there is
You can't hide from the truth, cause the truth is all there is

You can't hide from the truth
Because the truth is all there is
You can't hide from the truth.
You can't hide...
