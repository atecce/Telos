			"I heard about this frog
			 It's a very tiny frog
			 But it's also very special
			 You can only find it in the jungle
			 So far away from here
			 But if you find it
			 And if you touch it
			 Your world can change forever

			 If you touch its skin 
			 You can feel your body changing
			 And your vision also!
			 Blue becomes red, and red becomes blue
			 And your mommy, suddenly becomes your daddy
			 And everything looks like a giant cupcake

			 And you keep laughing, and laughing, and laughing
			 Nothing is ever quite the same really
			 And after you finish laughing
			 It's time to turn into a frog yourself
			 It's very funny to be a frog
			 You can dive into the water, and cross the rivers, and the oceans
			 And you can jump all the time, and everywhere

			 Do you wanna play with me?
			 We could be a whole group of friends
			 A whole group of frogs
			 Jumping into the streets
			 Jumping into the planets
			 Climbing the buildings
			 Swimming in the lakes, and in the bathtubs
			 We would be hundreds, thousands, millions
			 The biggest group of friends the world has ever seen
			 Jumping and laughing... forever
			 
			 It would be great, right?"}}},

			 Was it just for show?

			 If they try to pull you out
			 Would you even go?
			 I thought you were the sweetest kill
			 Did you even know?

			 I held your hand until the light
			 The scars were on the back
			 And all the time we were the right
			 Was it just retract?

			 And they can try to put you down, wear you out
			 Get you through the idea of the luck
			 I thought you were the sweetest kill
			 Did we even know?

			 All the time, we get by, tryna figure out our lives
			 Like a fade out
			 All the time, we get by, tryna figure out our lives
			 Like a fade out

			 When we took the level ten
			 Was it just a twelve?
			 And when we went to where we've been
			 Was it just for self?

			 And they can try to wear you down, put you out
			 Get you through your will that won't work
			 I thought you were the sweetest kill
			 Could I even know?

			 All the time, we get by, tryna figure out our lives

			 There's always a siren
			 Singing you to shipwreck

			"Shadows settle on the place, that you left.
			 Our minds are troubled by the emptiness.
			 Destroy the middle, it's a waste of time.
			 From the perfect start to the finish line.

			 And if you're still breathing, you're the lucky ones.
			 'Cause most of us are heaving through corrupted lungs.
			 Setting fire to our insides for fun
			 Collecting names of the lovers that went wrong
			 The lovers that went wrong.

			 We are the reckless,
			 We are the wild youth
			 Chasing visions of our futures
			 One day we'll reveal the truth
			 That one will die before he gets there.

			 And if you're still bleeding, you're the lucky ones.
			 'Cause most of our feelings, they are dead and they are gone.
			 We're setting fire to our insides for fun.
			 Collecting pictures from a flood that wrecked our home,
			 It was a flood that wrecked this home.

			 And you caused it,
			 And you caused it,
			 And you caused it

			 Well I've lost it all, I'm just a silhouette,
			 A lifeless face that you'll soon forget,
			 My eyes are damp from the words you left,
			 Ringing in my head, when you broke my chest.
			 Ringing in my head, when you broke my chest.

			 And if you're in love, then you are the lucky one,
			 'Cause most of us are bitter over someone.
			 Setting fire to our insides for fun,
			 To distract our hearts from ever missing them.
			 But I'm forever missing him.

			"[Roisin Murphy]
			 Go ...

			 Go to the mountain if you must
			 Go to the burning bush
			 Happy would ease your troubled mind
			 I'll be prepared to stay behind?

			 I know you better than you think I do
			 Don't worry dear, this is why I fell in love with you
			 The man in the looking glass
			 Is looking back at you at last

			 You can't hide from the truth
			 Because the truth is all there is
			 You can't hide from the truth
			 Because the truth is all there is
			 You can't hide from the truth
			 Because the truth is all there is
			 You can't hide

			 If happy times are too few and far between
			 It's a pity dear, we can't erase the things we've seen
			 So disappear, vanish if you wish
			 Just go before you're swallowed up by bitterness

			 And the truth is you can't hide from the truth
			 And the truth hurts because the truth is all there is
			 I realized some time ago that I would have to let you go

			 May not be true to say that you'd return one day
			 But in your present state, you may as well not be here at all
			 You wear a thin disguise, it's from yourself you hide
			 Just take a look at us, we are heading for a fall

			 [J-Live]
			 Now presiding in this court of hip-hop
			 Justice, my rap forte?
			 Judge, jury, bailiff, and prosecuting D.A.
			 Et ceteris paribus
			 My modus operandi
			 It's carpe diem whether de facto or de jure
			 Comprende?
			 The people versus, you and your sensei
			 Teaching that style of word-play
			 Week of the Wednesday
			 Regardless of what your friends say
			 They're all dissable
			 Stricken from the record and deemed inadmissable
			 And this long arm of the law grabs a mic to
			 Shoot dope lines first and ask questions later
			 The death sentence of this live litigator
			 Will close the case tighter than the jaws of a 'gator
			 Stenographer steady loggin' the jargon
			 That your counselors are barkin', in hopes of a plea bargain
			 But when you read back verbatim
			 What they're saying to persuade them
			 They realize exactly how I've played them
			 I come with the truth, whole truth and nothing but
			 'Cause the truth hurts just as much as fuckin' with lies will
			 I brew skill with free fills from now until
			 Plagerizing MC's get their flows distilled

			 [Roisin Murphy]
			 Baby I won't die without you by my side
			 As long as you return into these arms that burn
			 Baby I won't die just take a look inside
			 Into these eyes that burn, come to these arms that yearn

			 I won't die, if you leave me high
			 I won't die if you're not by my side

			 And the truth hurts because the truth is all there is
			 And the truth hurts because the truth is all there is

			 You can't hide from the truth, cause the truth is all there is
			 You can't hide from the truth, cause the truth is all there is
			 You can't hide from the truth, cause the truth is all there is
			 You can't hide from the truth, cause the truth is all there is
			 You can't hide from the truth, cause the truth is all there is
			 You can't hide from the truth, cause the truth is all there is
			 You can't hide from the truth, cause the truth is all there is

			 You can't hide from the truth
			 Because the truth is all there is
			 You can't hide from the truth.
			 You can't hide..."}}}]
